# AtomicHabits

This app is all about building habits, no matter if they are new or if you want to get deeper into a given habit.

## Concept

This is still in the planning phase. Most of it can`t actually be done in AtomicHabits _yet_.

### Step 1: Establish a plan

The core idea of AtomicHabits is a sort of gamified habit system, that encourages positive behaviour through [reinforcement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reinforcement). 

1. Define your habits that you want to track. Remember to start small. Introducing too many habits will likely cause you to feel fatigued fast and just stop building the habit of building habits in the first place.

2. Rate the importance of the habit. Is it a big goal in your life? Is it very hard for you to do it?
3. Also rate how often you want to do it.

4. Create your reward structure. Enter anything that you could enjoy as a reward, like some delicious Pizza. Categorize how good that reward is. For example, an afternoon of Netflix is still less of a reward than putting 200â‚¬ towards your next Hawaii vacation.

### Step 2: Stick to your plan.

Set aside 10 minutes of each evening to reflect on your day. Since this is a webapp, you will most likely have to do it on your computer until I get around to implementing some sort of a mobile app. What did you do? Did you fail to do something? If so, why? Enter it into AtomicHabits.

### Step 3: Reap your rewards.

AtomicHabits will keep you updated on your progress. Calenders, bar graphs, all that fancy stuff will be on your personal dashboard. And after some time, you will get rewards. Those rewards will be dice-rolled from the pool of your rewards, so you can surprise yourself with something nice after all of the hard work.
